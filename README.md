## 🎨 Color Theory

This app focuses on **analogous color schemes** - colors that are adjacent to each other on the color wheel. These combinations are:

- Naturally harmonious and pleasing to the eye
- Perfect for creating serene, comfortable designs
- Commonly found in nature (sunsets, forests, oceans)
- Ideal for backgrounds, gradients, and cohesive themes
